# Awesome ArchivesSpace

> [ArchivesSpace](http://archivesspace.org/) is an open source, web application for managing archives information. The application is designed to support core functions in archives administration such as accessioning; description and arrangement of processed materials including analog, hybrid, and born-digital content; management of authorities (agents and subjects) and rights; and reference service. The application supports collection management and functions as a metadata authoring tool. 

## What is this list?

Awesome ArchivesSpace is an [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). It points to resources (code, blog posts, anything with a URL, really) regarding ArchivesSpace created by the community that are dispersed around the web. Resources are loosely categorized by broad topic.

The intended audience for the list is those who have decided to adopt ArchivesSpace (or already have implemented ASpace) and need some help on where to go next in a specific area, both ArchivesSpace members and non-members.

This list is not intended to be an exhaustive roadmap to ArchivesSpace implementation, but more as a "resource guide". Inclusion on the list isn't an endorsement of any kind.

## Contributing to the list

Please help us continue to collect and add relevant sources to Awesome ArchivesSpace. See the Contribution Guidelines [add link to contributing.md] for information on how to update this page. 

Awesome ArchivesSpace was initially populated with three categories of resources: Migrations, Plug-ins, and Integrations. Through that work, additional categories of interest were identified:  Implementation, Scripts, and Trainings and Documentation. We encourage the ArchivesSpace community to add links to these categories as well as welcome new category suggestions.

## Credits and ownership

Awesome ArchivesSpace was initially populated by the [Awesome ArchivesSpace Ad Hoc Working Group](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AC/pages/266797087/Awesome+ArchivesSpace+Working+Group), under the aegis of the Technical Advisory Council, in 2018. The working group was comprised of: Justin Dalton, Christina Luers, Anne Marie Lyons, and Maggie Hughes.

The ArchivesSpace community has ownership over Awesome ArchivesSpace. TAC Vice Chair has responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the list and any administrative issues. Please reach out to them if you have any further questions or suggestions that cannot be handled via a pull request. 

## General Resources

General Resources is a good place to start browsing and further familiarizing yourself with ArchivesSpace. Many of these links will also appear in the other, more specific categories.

In 2014, Hunter Library began transferring these finding aids to ArchivesSpace, an open source archives information management application. ArchivesSpace allowed librarians to publish and export EAD finding aids on the web. This article discusses the project as an interdepartmental collaboration among Special Collections, Cataloging, and Digital Projects. The authors consider this paper useful as a workflow model for libraries which lack technical infrastructure but want to transfer legacy collection descriptions to ArchivesSpace."
