# Awesome ArchivesSpace

> [ArchivesSpace](http://archivesspace.org/) is an open source, web application for managing archives information. The application is designed to support core functions in archives administration such as accessioning; description and arrangement of processed materials including analog, hybrid, and born-digital content; management of authorities (agents and subjects) and rights; and reference service. The application supports collection management and functions as a metadata authoring tool. 

## What is this list?

Awesome ArchivesSpace is an [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). It points to resources (code, blog posts, anything with a URL, really) regarding ArchivesSpace created by the community that are dispersed around the web. Resources are loosely categorized by broad topic.

The intended audience for the list is those who have decided to adopt ArchivesSpace (or already have implemented ASpace) and need some help on where to go next in a specific area, both ArchivesSpace members and non-members.

This list is not intended to be an exhaustive roadmap to ArchivesSpace implementation, but more as a "resource guide". Inclusion on the list isn't an endorsement of any kind.

## Contributing to the list

Please help us continue to collect and add relevant sources to Awesome ArchivesSpace. See the Contribution Guidelines [add link to contributing.md] for information on how to update this page. 

Awesome ArchivesSpace was initially populated with three categories of resources: Migrations, Plug-ins, and Integrations. Through that work, additional categories of interest were identified:  Implementation, Scripts, and Trainings and Documentation. We encourage the ArchivesSpace community to add links to these categories as well as welcome new category suggestions.
